# watchpackage

dunno just to remembre how to do python packages and Continuous Integration

made only in educational purposes

some pointer for my future self:

    - install vitrualenv and pytest
    - git - actions -> set up new workflow with steps for actions
    - fill setup.py in root
    - check yourself before you wreck yourself (.gitignore)
    - bruh.mp3 + reverb
    - stay black cuz it's most important
